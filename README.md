# DriftDelivery
## Description
DriftDelivery is my pet project. The idea of it was looked from [this test task](https://github.com/avito-tech/safedeal-backend-trainee). I've decided try to develop delivery service api on Elixir. This will help me to be a better Backend Developer in future.

## Requirements 
1. PostgreSQL

## To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or `iex -S mix phx.server` for interactive mode.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
